cd Ticket-managment-system

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

You can download it from nodejs.org.

#### MongoDB:
Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running. You can find installation instructions at mongodb.com.

You can check if you have Node.js and npm installed by running:
node -v
npm -v

### Using MongoDB Compass
If you prefer a graphical interface, you can use MongoDB Compass:

#### 1.Open MongoDB Compass: 
Launch the application.
#### 2.Connect to Your MongoDB Instance: 
Enter the connection string (usually mongodb://localhost:27017 for local installations) and click "Connect."
#### 3.Create a Database:
- Click on "Create Database."
- Enter your desired database name and the name of your first collection (e.g., tickets).
- Click "Create Database."

### Testing
You can test the API endpoints using tools like Postman to ensure that all operations are functioning as expected.

### Example requests:
- POST to /api/tickets to create a ticket.
- GET from /api/tickets to get all tickets.
- GET from /api/ticket/:id to retrieve a specific ticket by its ID.
